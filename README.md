SimpleRegister
==============

A simple [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) plugin that creates Register link containing an email to administrator. This is an alternative to [AccountManagerPlugin](http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/AccountManagerPlugin) that allows to manually validate the registration and avoid SPAM. I am aware that the latest version of above plugin allows admin validation, but it is still not stable enough for production use.
